I am a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at University of Southern California (USC) advised by Dr. [Sven Koenig](idm-lab.org).

Before joining USC, I received my B.S. degree at Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, and got my M.S. degree at Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University.

My research interests lie in systematic design integrating planning algorithms with real world applications. Currently, I am working on developing hierarchical algorithms for multiple agents to navigate without collisions, known as Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF). The objective of my research is to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and robotics.
