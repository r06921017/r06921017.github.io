About me
======
I am a second year Ph.D. student in CoOmputer Science at University of Southern California (USC) advised by Dr. [Sven Koenig](idm-lab.org).

Before joining USC, I received my B.S. degree at Department of Electrical Engineering, National Cheng Kung University, in 2017, and got my M.S. degree at Department of Electrical Engineering, National Taiwan University, in 2019.

My research interests lie in systematic design integrating planning algorithms and real world applications. I also works in developing hierarchical algorithmsfor multiple agents to navigate without collisions.
