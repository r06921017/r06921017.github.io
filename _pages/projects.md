## 2020
### Inverse Reinforcement Learning for InferringHuman-Centered Costmaps
*Course: Computational Human Robot Interaction, Lecturer: Prof. Stefanos Nikolaidis, USC*
* A scalable method to collect information on task-basedpersonal space.
* An algorithm for inferring a task-based costmap from adataset of motion capture trajectories of two humans.

## 2019
### Master Thesis: Optimal Navigation System for a Mobile Robot to Execute Dynamical Multiple Social Tasks
*Advisor: Dr. Li-Chen Fu, NTUEE*
* A navigation system integrated with perception module and decision making system can handle dynamical social tasks during human robot interaction.
* A model that formulates the household environment into discrete graph and task into time-decaying reward function can transfer complex social task planning problem to mathematical optimization problem. 
* A task planning algorithm using relative low memory consumption in time such that the robot can deal with scenarios when newly-added social tasks are called from human. 

### Multi-Agent Path Finding with Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU)
*Course: Coordinate Robotics, Lecturer: Prof. Nora Ayanian, USC*
* Apply STNU to MAPF to deal with uncertainty to deal with uncertainty movements during plan execution.

## 2018
### Real-time Human, Object, Pose Detection for Service Robots [[link](https://a9451406.wixsite.com/gpgpurobotproject)] 
*Course: GPU Programming, Lecturer: Prof. Wei-Chao Chen, NTUEE*
* Developed a system for robot to execute commands given by human gesture and voice.

### Face Recognition with Squeezed Deep Learning Model [[poster](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jlZSmr7yZB87IewN-447M4WQPaK8Qv4I/view)]
*Course: Deep Learn for Computer Vision, Lecturer: Prof. Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, NTUEE*
* Developed a face recognition network with squeezed model combing InceptionNet, Inception-ResNet, and ShuffleNet.
* Trained and tetsted on CelebA Dataset, comparing with VGG-16 with the testing accuracy about 0.6, the testing accuracy of our model is 0.65 with ten times fewer parameters.

## 2017
### Making Latte Art through ITRI Robotic Arm
*Course: Robotics, Lecturer: Prof. Li-Chen Fu, NTUEE*
* Manipulated robot arm to generate latte art given a certain pattern while recognizing objects like cups, stir bar with top view camera.

### Machine Translation for Native Taiwanese Language on Local Drama Conversation
*Course: Machine Learning, Lecturer Prof. Hung-Yi Lee, NTUEE*
* Developed a word-embedded model trained on Conversation Native Language Dataset with 0.51 accuracy, while the best model on Kaggle is 0.55.

## 2016
### Solving Marble Maze with Universal Robot UR5 [[link](https://awehandsomemore.wixsite.com/ur5projectmarblemaze)]
*Course: Introduction to Robotics, Lecturer: Prof. Ruzena Bajcsy, Department of EECS, UC Berkeley*
* Encoded the corner of the maze and solve the adequate path for the marble.
